# Vehicle-Automatic-Braking-STM32
Embedded Software Part of my BSc Graduation Project.

Project performs automatic braking of the vehicle based on the required deceleration calculated from the distance and speed received from the deep learning algorithms. 
(Not included in this part)

Project idea is based on turning off the brake control unit using some relays, and enabling the microcontroller to control the braking charge pump with a specific
duty cycle.
